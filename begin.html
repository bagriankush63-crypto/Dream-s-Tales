        <h1>Begin - The First Chapter!</h1>
        <h2>The Journey to the City</h2>
        <p>Ravi was a 10-year-old boy who lived in a small village surrounded by green fields, tall trees, and muddy
            roads. Every morning, he woke up to the sound of birds and the smell of fresh soil after the farmers watered
            their crops. He loved playing with his friends near the pond and helping his father in the खेत (farm). Life
            was simple, and everyone in the village knew each other.

            One day, Ravi’s father told him that they were moving to a big city permanently. His father had found a
            better job there, and they wanted Ravi to get a good education. Ravi felt happy and sad at the same time. He
            was excited to see tall buildings and big roads, but he didn’t want to leave his friends, his school, and
            his village.

            The day they left, Ravi hugged his best friend Aman and promised to stay in touch. He looked back at his
            village from the bus window, watching the trees and fields slowly disappear. His heart felt heavy, but he
            also dreamed about his new life.

            When Ravi reached the city, everything felt different. There were big buildings, noisy traffic, bright
            lights, and many people. At first, he felt scared and lonely because he missed the quiet village life. But
            soon, he started going to a new school, made new friends, and learned many new things.

            Ravi realized that even though he left his village, it would always stay in his heart. He promised himself
            that one day he would visit his village again and tell everyone about his city life.

            And so, his new journey in the city began.</p>
        <h2>Ravi’s New School and His First Crush</h2>
        <p>After shifting to the city, Ravi slowly got used to his new life. He took admission in a big school where
            classrooms were large, teachers were strict, and students came from different places. At first, Ravi missed
            his village friends and quiet life, but soon he started enjoying city school.

            He studied hard, made new friends, and learned many new things like computers, science experiments, and
            English speaking. His life was going smoothly, and he was becoming more confident every day.

            One day, when Ravi was in 6th standard, something special happened.

            A new student joined his class.

            Her name was Ananya.

            She was a pretty and kind girl with a bright smile and long hair tied in two braids. When she entered the
            classroom, everyone started whispering. The teacher asked her to introduce herself, and she spoke very
            politely. Ravi was sitting on the third bench and couldn’t stop looking at her.

            For the first time, Ravi felt something strange in his heart. He didn’t know what it was. His heart beat
            fast, and he felt shy when Ananya sat near him. He tried to act normal, but he kept thinking about her.

            Slowly, they started talking. They shared pencils, talked about homework, and laughed during lunch break.
            Ananya was friendly, and Ravi felt happy whenever she smiled at him.

            Ravi realized that this was his first crush—a simple, innocent feeling that made him happy and nervous at
            the same time.

            He didn’t tell anyone about it, but in his diary, he wrote:

            “Today a new girl joined our class. I think she is very nice. I feel happy when I see her.”

            Life in the city was changing Ravi, and a new chapter of his childhood had begun.</p>
        <h2>The Beginning of a Friendship</h2>
        <p>Ravi liked Ananya, but he was a very shy boy. He didn’t know how to talk to her properly. Many times, he
            wanted to say “Hi,” but his words stayed stuck in his mouth. He thought, “What if she thinks I am weird?”

            But Ravi was determined. He started making small efforts.

            He helped her with homework when she didn’t understand math.
            He shared his notes when she missed a class.
            He gave her a pen when hers stopped working.

            Slowly, Ananya noticed that Ravi was kind and helpful. They started talking more during lunch breaks and
            group projects. They laughed about teachers, shared stories about their families, and talked about their
            favorite cartoons and games.

            One day, Ravi saw Ananya’s school ID card on her desk. On the back, the school had printed a student contact
            number for emergency purposes. Ravi felt nervous but thought, “I just want to be her friend.”

            That evening, he sent a simple message:

            “Hi Ananya, this is Ravi from your class. Hope you are doing well 🙂”

            He waited nervously, checking his phone again and again.

            After some time, she replied:

            “Hi Ravi! Yes, I am fine. How are you?”

            Ravi felt so happy that he couldn’t sleep properly that night. They started chatting about homework, school
            projects, and random things like favorite movies and songs.

            That day was the beginning of their friendship.

            Ravi realized that making an effort and being kind was more important than being shy. He didn’t know what
            the future would bring, but he knew that he had found a good friend in the big city.

            And his story with Ananya had just started…</p>
        <h1>When the World Stopped</h1>
        <h2>When Lockdown Happened</h2>
        <p>One morning, Ravi was getting ready for school when his father suddenly turned on the TV. The news was
            serious. People were talking about a dangerous virus spreading everywhere. The government announced a
            lockdown, and schools were closed until further notice.

            At first, Ravi jumped with joy.
            “No school! No homework!” he shouted.

            But soon, the streets became empty, shops were closed, and everyone stayed inside their houses. Ravi looked
            out of the window and saw no children playing, no school buses, and no noise. The city felt silent, like it
            was sleeping.</p>
        <h2>Scene: Enjoying Lockdown with Family</h2>
        <p>During lockdown, Ravi spent all day with his family.
            In the afternoon, he and his sister played Ludo on the floor. His father joined sometimes and always joked,
            “You are cheating! I saw you move two steps extra!”

            In the evening, Ravi played Carrom with his parents. The striker flew off the board, and everyone laughed
            loudly. His mother made tea and biscuits, and they sat together watching old movies and funny shows.

            At night, they played Chess, and Ravi tried very hard to beat his father. Sometimes he won, sometimes he
            lost, but he always enjoyed the time.

            Ravi felt happy because he had never spent so much time with his family before.</p>
        <h2>Before lockdown, one day in class, Ananya had kept her school ID card on her desk while writing notes. Ravi
            accidentally saw it.
            On the back of the card, the school had printed basic student details and a contact number for school
            communication.

            Ravi felt nervous. He thought,
            “Should I save it? I only want to talk as a friend…”

            He quietly memorized the number and saved it in his phone with the name “Ananya Classmate”. He promised
            himself that he would never disturb her and would only message politely.</h2>

        <h2>Scene: First WhatsApp Message</h2>
        <p>During lockdown, Ravi missed school and Ananya a lot. One evening, after playing Ludo, he sat on his bed
            holding his phone. His heart was beating fast.

            He opened WhatsApp and typed a message many times, deleted it, and typed again.

            Finally, he sent:

            Ravi: “Hi Ananya, this is Ravi from your class. I saw your number on the school ID card. Hope you don’t
            mind.”

            He waited. Minutes felt like hours.

            After some time, his phone vibrated.

            Ananya: “Hi Ravi! It’s okay 🙂 How are you? Lockdown is so boring.”

            Ravi smiled so much that his cheeks hurt.
            He replied:

            Ravi: “I’m fine. Yes, I miss school and our class.”

            They started talking about online classes, teachers, homework, and funny memes. Sometimes they talked late
            at night until their parents told them to sleep.</p>

        <h2>Ravi’s Feelings</h2>
        <p>Even though the world was locked down, Ravi felt that something new had opened in his life.
            He was close to his family and also closer to Ananya through messages.

            He thought:
            “Maybe lockdown is not all bad. I got more time with my family and a good friend too.”

            And so, during the silent lockdown days, Ravi’s friendship with Ananya became stronger.</p>
        <h1>The Confession Night</h1>
        <p>Lockdown nights were always quiet. The city streets were silent, but Ravi’s mind was never quiet.
            Every day, he talked to Ananya. She listened to him, helped him in studies, and laughed at his jokes.
            Slowly, she became the most important person in his city life.

            But inside his heart, something was changing.

            He didn’t just see her as a friend anymore.</p>
        <h2>Scene: Ravi Alone in His Room</h2>
        <p>One night, after finishing dinner and playing Chess with his father, Ravi went to his room. The lights were
            dim, and outside the window, the moon was shining. He opened WhatsApp and saw Ananya’s profile picture.

            His heart started beating fast.

            He whispered to himself:
            “If I don’t tell her today, I will never tell her.”

            He typed a message, deleted it.
            Typed again, deleted again.
            His fingers were shaking.

            Finally, he decided.</p>
        <h2>The Confession Chat</h2>
        <p>Ravi: “Ananya… are you free? I want to talk about something important.”

            Ananya: “Yes Ravi, what happened? You sound serious.”

            Ravi stared at the screen for a few seconds.

            Ravi: “Promise you won’t get angry.”

            Ananya: “I promise 🙂 Just tell me.”

            Ravi closed his eyes and typed slowly.

            Ravi: “Since we started talking, you became very special to me. I think about you every day. I don’t know
            how to say this… but I think I like you more than a friend.”

            He stopped. His heart was pounding.
            Then he typed again.

            Ravi: “I think I love you.”

            He pressed Send.</p>
        <h2>Waiting for Her Reply</h2>
        <p>Seconds felt like hours.
            Ravi put his phone down, picked it up again, checked the message status: Seen.

            But no reply.

            He started imagining worst things:
            “What if she blocks me?”
            “What if she tells everyone?”
            “What if she hates me?”

            His hands became cold.</p>
        <h2>Ananya’s Honest Reply</h2>
        <p>After a few minutes, her message came.

            Ananya: “Ravi… I was surprised by your message.”

            Ravi’s heart stopped for a moment.

            Ananya: “You are a very sweet person and my best friend. I care about you a lot.”

            Ravi waited silently.

            Then she wrote:

            Ananya: “But I don’t feel the same way. I like you and love you… but only as a friend.”

            Ravi felt a sharp pain in his chest. His eyes became wet.

            She continued:

            Ananya: “I hope you don’t feel bad. You are very important to me. I don’t want to lose our friendship.”</p>
        <h2>Ravi’s Emotional Reply</h2>
        <p>Ravi stared at the message for a long time.
            He didn’t know what to say. His heart was broken, but he also respected her honesty.

            He slowly typed:

            Ravi: “It’s okay. Thank you for telling me the truth. I understand.”

            After a few seconds, he added:

            Ravi: “You are my best friend too. I will never force you or make you uncomfortable.”

            Ananya replied:

            Ananya: “Thank you for understanding 😊 You are a great friend, Ravi.”</p>
        <h2>Ravi’s Feelings That Night</h2>
        <p>That night, Ravi kept his phone aside and looked at the ceiling.
            He felt sad, but he didn’t cry loudly. He just felt silent pain.

            He remembered his village, his old friends, and how he dreamed about city life.
            He realized that growing up means understanding emotions and accepting reality.

            He whispered:
            “Maybe this is what first love feels like.”

            The next day, he still talked to Ananya like before. He laughed with his family while playing Ludo. Slowly,
            he learned to hide his feelings and value friendship more.</p>
        <h2>Moral of the Scene</h2>
        <p>Ravi learned a big lesson:
            👉 Not every love becomes love, but respect and friendship always matter.</p>
        <h1>The Tuition Meeting</h1>
        <h2>Months had passed since Ravi confessed his feelings.
            Lockdown was still going on, but slowly restrictions were reducing. Tuition classes had started again with
            limited students. Ravi and Ananya were still chatting every day, but both felt something was different now.

            One evening, just before Ananya was about to leave for tuition, she sent Ravi a message.</h2>
        <h2>Scene: The Invitation</h2>
        <p>Ananya: “Ravi, are you coming to tuition today?”

            Ravi: “Yes, I’m going. Why?”

            She paused for a few minutes. Then her message came.

            Ananya: “Can we meet for a few minutes outside the tuition class? I want to tell you something in person.”

            Ravi’s heart skipped a beat.

            Ravi: “Tell me here. What happened?”

            Ananya: “No… I want to tell you face to face. It’s important.”

            Ravi felt nervous and excited at the same time.

            Ravi: “Okay. I’ll come early.”

            Ananya: “Good. See you there.”</p>
        <h2>Scene: Outside the Tuition Center</h2>
        <p>That evening, Ravi reached tuition 15 minutes early.
            The sky was orange and purple, and the streets were quiet. Students were slowly arriving. Ravi stood near
            the gate, looking at his phone again and again.

            Then he saw Ananya coming with her bag on her shoulder. She looked a little nervous but also confident. When
            she saw Ravi, she smiled slightly.

            “Hi,” she said softly.

            “Hi,” Ravi replied, his voice shaking.

            They walked a little away from the gate so no one could hear them.</p>
        <h1>The end of first chapter...</h1>
        <p>The evening air felt heavy, and Ravi could hear his own heartbeat. Ananya stopped walking and looked at him
            seriously, as if she had practiced this moment many times in her mind. Ravi wanted to speak, but no words
            came out. He just waited.

            Whatever Ananya was about to say would change everything between them. Ravi did not know whether he should
            feel happy or scared. That conversation at the tuition gate would stay in his memory forever.

            What Ananya finally told Ravi that evening will be revealed in Part 2.</p>
