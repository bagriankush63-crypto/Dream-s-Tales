    <h1>The Curse More Than Blessing !</h1>

    <p>
       <p>
In the kingdom of Lugunica, where the air smells of faint mana and the rustle of carriage wheels, 
Natsuki Subaru sat on a stone bench, staring at a half-eaten bag of corn snacks.  

<br><br>
He had been in this world for months. He had died more times than he cared to count. 
But today, the sun was warm, the market was bustling, and for once, nobody was trying to kill him.  

<br><br>
"Subaru? You’re making that face again. The one where you look like you’re trying to solve a math problem in a language that doesn't exist."  

<br><br>
Subaru blinked and looked up. Emilia stood before him, her silver hair shimmering like moonlight caught in a silk weave. 
Beside her, Puck floated lazily, grooming a paw.  

<br><br>
"Just thinking about how lucky I am, Emilia-tan!" Subaru beamed, throwing a peace sign.  
"A beautiful half-elf, a fluffy cat-spirit, and a day with zero stabbings. It’s a 10/10."  

<br><br>
<b>The Calm Before the Gale</b>  

<br><br>
Their peaceful afternoon was interrupted by a sudden, unnatural chill.  
The bustling sounds of the capital’s merchant district didn't fade—they snapped into silence.  

<br><br>
Subaru stood up, his hand instinctively going to the short sword at his hip.  
"Emilia, get behind me."  

<br><br>
"Subaru, look," she whispered, pointing toward the center of the plaza.  

<br><br>
The shadows were stretching. Not because the sun was setting, but because something was pulling them.  
A rift, jagged and ink-black, tore open in the air.  
From it stepped a figure draped in rags that seemed to swallow the light around them.  

<br><br>
"The Witch's scent..." Puck’s voice lost its playfulness, becoming deep and resonant.  
"It’s thick enough to choke on."  

<br><br>
<b>The Unseen Choice</b>  

<br><br>
The figure didn't attack. It simply held out a hand.  
In its palm sat a small, crystalline flower—a Frost-Fire Lily, a rare bloom said to grant a single wish to those who could withstand its cold.  

<br><br>
"For the candidate," the figure rasped. "A gift from the abyss."  

<br><br>
Subaru felt the familiar, sickening tug in his chest. Return by Death pulsed like a second heartbeat.  
He saw the scene play out in his mind before it happened:  

<br>
• Emilia reaches for the flower.  
<br>
• The flower shatters, releasing a curse.  
<br>
• The entire plaza is frozen in an instant.  

<br><br>
"Wait!" Subaru lunged forward, grabbing Emilia’s wrist just inches from the crystal.  

<br><br>
"Subaru? What’s wrong?"  

<br><br>
"Don't touch it," he breathed, his forehead beaded with sweat.  
"Trust me. It’s a trap. A nasty, 'end-of-the-world' kind of trap."  

<br><br>
<b>The Aftermath</b>  

<br><br>
The figure tilted its head, then dissolved into a cloud of black smoke, leaving only the scent of ozone and decay behind.  
The plaza returned to life—the chatter of merchants, the smell of roasted meat, the warmth of the sun.  

<br><br>
Emilia looked at Subaru, her violet eyes searching his. She didn't ask how he knew.  
She had learned by now that Subaru’s "intuition" was a heavy burden he carried for her sake.  

<br><br>
"Thank you, Subaru," she said softly, squeezing his hand. "For watching over me."  

<br><br>
"Always," Subaru replied, though his heart was still racing.  
He looked at his shaking hands and forced a grin.  
"But hey, since I saved the day, does that mean I get an extra helping of Rem’s steamed potatoes tonight?"  

<br><br>
"I think we can manage that," Emilia laughed.
